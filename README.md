# -Autonomous-Robot-Jar-Collection-System
A fully autonomous mobile robot system that navigates a 20×20 meter warehouse, detects honey jars using color-based computer vision, manipulates objects with a gripper, and places them in designated storage areas. The robot combines multiple sensor modalities with real-time path planning to autonomously complete complex manipulation tasks.
